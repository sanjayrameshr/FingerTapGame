# Tap-to-Grow Game (Flutter)

A simple and fun 2-player game built using **Flutter**, where two players compete by tapping their side of the screen to grow their color block. The player who fills the screen first wins!

---

## Game Concept

- The screen is divided into two vertical halves:
  - ðŸ”µ **Player A (Top - Blue)**
  - ðŸ”´ **Player B (Bottom - Red)**
- Each tap increases the player's height and reduces the opponent's.
- Each successful tap adds **5 points**.
- The player who fills the screen first is the **winner**.

## Screens

1. **Main Page**
   - Two big circular "START!!" buttons (top and bottom).
2. **Game Page**
   - Two tappable halves representing each player.
   - Score displayed.
3. **Result Page**
   - Winner announcement.
   - Restart option.
